# Authentication_System
## SNHU CS-499 2021

This project involves the refinment of the final project for the class IT-145. This project was the creation of a zoo authentication system for a hypethetial zoo. This was done in java and was made up of a login screen which would allow the entering of a username and password. If the username/password combination was correct, the system would then display one of three text pages related to the user account type.
More information can be found in the code review below.
